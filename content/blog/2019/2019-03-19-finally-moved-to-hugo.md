Steep learning curve and at least a Month later I have the blog running on [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), after about 7 years on Jekyll.

The main issue I have had with Jekyll is the dependency on Ruby Gems, these need regular updating and can break the rendering of the site, hopefully [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) being self contained will not suffer from this problem.
